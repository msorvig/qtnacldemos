This is a slide presentation system written in QML.



Installing
----------

No installation is required. Just add the root directory to your QML_IMPORT_PATH
and run 'qmlscene' on your slides to run presentations. 



Organization
------------

There is a tutorial covering most features under:
  examples/tutorial/SlideDeck.qml
This is a good place to start if you want to use it.

Examples on more advanced presentations are located here:
  examples/customtransition/SlideDeck.qml
  examples/animatedbackground/SlideDeck.qml

The source code for the Slide and Presentation elements are located under:
  Qt/labs/presentation



Usage Tips
----------

 - The default size of presentations is hardcoded into the presentation .qml
   file. One can pass '--fullscreen' on the command line to qmlscene to show
   the presentation fullscreen.
